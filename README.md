# IRLEDS
Control 3 Pin RGB LED Strips with an Arduino and an IR Remote control.

# Wiring
Wiring is written in code, but it's as follows :
  LED Data -> Pin 7
  IR Sensor -> Pin 8
 
# Requirements 
This sketch requires two librairies, FastLED, to control the LEDS, and IRremote to receive data from the remote.
